'''Fair use rationale for an image of an audio recording cover'''
*It is believed that the use of this image on the English-language Wikipedia to illustrate an article on the audio recording in question falls under the \"Non-profit educational\" clause of the Fair Use doctrine currently upheld by United States law. ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000107----000-.html 17 U.S.C. ยง 107])
*The image is irreplaceable; a free analogue is impossible to produce as the original will be covered by copyright for the foreseeable future.
*Owing to the limited web-resolution of the image, only a small portion of a copyrighted work is used.
*For the same reasons, the portion of the copyrighted work used is of inherently lower quality than the original, reducing the risk of competitiveness and therefore the effects of this copy on the market for or value of versions held by the owner of the copyright.
